        "# Synthetic Tabular Data Generation by NeMo GPT\n",
        "\n",
        "Big data, new algorithms and fast computers are the 3 main factors that make the modern AI revolution possible. Data poses a big challenge for enterprises for various reasons: difficulty  of data labeling, strong data governance, limited data availability etc. Synthetic data generation is proposed as a solution to the data problem as it directly addresses the data challenges. Two popular generative models like  Variational Auto-Encoder [VAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder) and Generative Adversarial Network [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) models have achieved some success in the past. However, a good generative model should generate the data following the same distribution as the training data. There are some known flaws with the VAE and GAN models for synthetic data generation. Most prominently, the [mode collapse problem](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/problems) in the GAN model causes the generated data to miss some modes in the training data distribution. While the VAE has the difficulty of generating sharp data points due to the non-autoregressive loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recently, [Transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) achieved huge success in the natural language processing domain.  The self-attention encoding and decoding architecture of the transformer model is proven to be accurate in modeling the data distribution and scalable to large datasets. [OpenAI’s GPT3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) uses the decoder part of the transformer model and has 175B parameters. It has been widely used across varying categories and industries, from productivity and education to creativity and games. GPT3 turns out to be a superior generative model. In this tutorial, we are interested in exploring the ideas of applying the GPT model for synthetic data generation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike typical neural networks, GPT models are usually large in size. It is challenging to fit a large GPT model into a single GPU. Luckily, [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is an open source tool that is capable of efficiently training very large (hundreds of billions of parameters) language models with both model and data parallelism.  It is easy to use too. In the following sections, we will show how to train a GPT model step by step to generate synthetic credit card data.\n"

        "As shown in the figure above, it illustrates the steps we are going to take in this tutorial. Having the raw text data ready, we first train a tokenizer to efficiently tokenize the text.  As NeMo only cares about sequences of tokens, a preprocess step is used to convert the raw text data into sequences of token index. It results in one binary file and an index file so data loading in the training step is more efficient.  The next step is the most time consuming pre-training step in which sequences of tokens are fed into the NeMo GPT to predict the next tokens. The prediction error is used as the loss to train the GPT weights. After training the GPT model, it can be put into an inference mode to generate synthetic data following the same distribution as the training dataset. \n",

        "### Tokenizer training\n",
        "It is natural to select the generic GPT BPE tokenizer to convert the text into tokens. However, there are a few problems of using this approach. When GPT BPE tokenizer splits the text into tokens, the number of tokens are usually not fixed for the same column at different rows, because the number is determined by the occurrence frequencies of the individual sub-tokens. This means the structure information is lost if we use the NLP tokenizer. Another problem with the NLP tokenizer is the long string consists of a large number of tokens, which is wasteful considering the NeMo GPT has limited capacity of modeling the sequences of tokens. For example the \"Merchant Name\" \"3527213246127876953\" need at least 7 tokens to code it ([35][27][213][246][127][876][953]). \n",
        "\n",
        "As shown in the [TabFormer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01843), a good solution is to build a specialized tokenizer for the tabular data that considers the table structural information. The TabFormer uses a single token for each of the columns which can cause either accuracy loss if the number of tokens is small for the column, or weak generalization if the number of tokens is too large. We improve it by using multiple tokens to code the columns. For example, the floating number \"134.09\" can be tokenized into multiple integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following code trains a special encoder/decoder used in the tokenizer. It uses `float` for the `Amount` column, `int` for the `zip` column and `category` for the rest of the columns. The trained encoder and decoder are saved into a file that can be loaded later. We choose to use 3 tokens to encode the floating and int numbers in this example."

For the categorical column \"Merchant City\", the string \"Monterey Park\" only needs one token to encode it. Once we have the encoder and decoder ready, the tokenizer is easy to implement. We can consider the tabular data structure information to encode each of the columns. The decoding simply counts the number of tokens to infer the tabular structure since the number of the tokens are fixed for each of the columns.\n",

The attention mask will stop at the boundary of `<|endoftext|>` token so no attention can be applied across it. To model the temporal information in the time series, we want to make sure the `<|endoftext|>` is added between the continuous sections. For example, in this credit card dataset, there are 2000 users. Each user's transactions are one long time series sequence. The `<|endoftext|>` is added at the end of the long sequences. In this way, NeMo applies attention to learn the temporal correlation in the transactions for the user but not across users. \n",

        "We are ready to pretrain the NeMo GPT model. As large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints, NeMo makes it possible by using both Tensor model parallel and Pipeline model parallelism that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. On top of the model parallelism, we can apply the popular data parallelism to the training to fully utilize all the GPUs in the cluster. In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04473.pdf), it provides a few tips about how to setup the model parallelism and data parallelism optimally:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. When considering different forms of model parallelism, tensor model parallelism should generally be used up to degree 𝑔 when using 𝑔-GPU servers, and then pipeline model parallelism can be used to scale up to larger models across server.\n",
        "2. When using data and model parallelism, a total model-parallel size of 𝑀 = 𝑡 · 𝑝 should be used so that the model’s parameters and intermediate metadata fit in GPU memory; data parallelism can be used to scale up training to more GPUs.\n",
        "3. The optimal microbatch size 𝑏 depends on the throughput and memory footprint characteristics of the model, as well as the pipeline depth 𝑝, data-parallel size 𝑑, and batch size 𝐵.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we only concern with training a model that fits into a single GPU. we set the tensor model parallel and pipeline model parallelism parameter to 1. Feel free to adjust it to train a larger model according to the available compute resources. As we know from OpenAI's [scaling law of natural language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361), the larger the model, the better the performance is.\n",

        "The above code only generate `num_of_rows` of transactions starting from the beginning. If longer sequence is needed, we can run the inference conditioned on the past transactions in a sliding window fashion. For example, first it generates [A, B, C, D, E] transactions conditioned on `<|endoftext|>` token. Then, it conditions on [D, E] and generates [D, E, F, G, H]. Once the long sequence comes to the end indicated by `<|endoftext|>`, it will keep generating new transactions for a different user. For example, after generating [X, Y, Z, <|endoftext|>] in the last run, it will generate [Z, <|endoftext|>, A', B', C'] in the next time, where A', B', C' are transactions for a different user and they are not depending on the other users transaction Z.  \n",

The `history_rows` specifies the number of rows of transactions used as conditional context and `num_of_rows` specify the number of rows of transactions to be generated at a time. It saves all the synthetic credit card transactions in the text files whose file names starts with prefix `synthetic`. You can adjust `number_of_blocks`, `batch_size` parameters to generate more transactions.  "
